* .75 - Correcting bugs in the nrl, linear, and log remap functions
* .74 - Introducing the ability to read SICD, SIDD, and some NITF files from file-like object
        This is generally geared towards usage with smart_open for possible S3 usage
* .73 - Correcting another mistake in the SIDD version 2 schema and element production
* .72 - Corrected some mistakes in the included SIDD version 2 schema
* .71 - Introducing basic SIDD consistency check, and debugging the squint calculation

        Debugging of poor classification extraction in SIDD production for both versions
        Reorganization of SIDD schemas and inclusion in package data
* .69 - Debugging SIDD Version 1.0 structure producted in create_product methods
* .68 - Introduction of a reader implementation which directly uses an array or memmap,
        which is intended merely to provide unified integration for tool usage.
* .67 - Fix for the range doppler rate polynomial definition for Cosmo SkyMed
* .66 - Updating Cosmo SkyMed 2nd generation column impulse response population
        Introduces helper method for converting image coordinates to coordinates for polynomial evaluation
        Fixed sign convention in SICD related Fourier helper methods
        Fixed state issues with ortho-rectification model populated from sicd.RadarCollection.Area

* .62 - CPHD Consistency Improvements
* .61 - Introduction of Cosmo SkyMed 2nd generation support

          read band sequential format, and correction of band interleaved by
          block reading. What remains is more general support for compression,
          which is likely not high on the list of priorities.

* .55 - Bug fixes for CPHD writing
* .54 - Further debugging SICD.RadarCollect.Area for definition for default SIDD image bounds
* .53 - Introducing CPHD 1.0 writing capabilities and improved CPHD reading for both versions
* .52 - Use SICD.RadarCollect.Area for definition for default SIDD image bounds
* .51 - Introduced validity check for SICD in the consistency module
* .50 - Imposing print function complicance for Python 2.7 usage
* .49 - Completion of annotation and geometry elements for apps usage
* .48 - Bug fixes for CPHD AntGainPhase support array reading
        Labeling schema modifications and geometry elements modifications
* .47 - Modification of extracted CSK metadata for proper ImpRespBW population
        Top level structures for SICD, SIDD, and CPHD better handle default xml tag
        Change to aperture_filter for sarpy_apps usage
        Changes and fixes in geometry_elements for sarpy_apps usage
* .46 - Valkyrie added CPHD consistency checked and some CPHD associated unit tests

* .42 - Minor fix to setup.py definition
* .41 - Added reader_type property for reader to clarify intent and usage
* .40 - Debugging CMETAA definition and usage
* .39 - Debugging the Exploitation Calculator for SIDD population
* .38 - Adjust TRE definitions to avoid errors in improperly parsing numeric fields
* .37 - Adding preliminary support for NITF 2.0

* .34 - Correction for difference between KompSat and CSK metadata
* .33 - Correction of radar mode determination for KompSat
* .32 - Bug fixes for Cosmo Skymed and fine-tuning KompSat support
