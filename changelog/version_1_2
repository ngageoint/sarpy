* .31 - Adding a command-line utility for adding a nominal noise polynomial
* .30 - Account for noise and Radiometric SF poly changes due to subaperture

        Using the correct zero doppler time for CSG format data
* .28 - Bug fixes for sicd validation of version 1.1 date and pfa bounds
            consistency checking for the spotlight case
        Ensure that FTITLE and IID2 nitf header fields in a sicd file will be
            prefixed with 'SICD:' if attepting to write a version 1.1 file
* .27 - Bug fix for left looking terrasarx sicd
* .26 - Replacing the bad slice convention parsing from the __call__ method with
        the standard expected for Python
* .25 - Separated CPHD and CRSD reading and writing implementations into separate
        sub-packages, and continued specific reader type base pattern for clarity
* .24 - Refactoring to present remaps to be classes versus flat functions, for
            the purposes of coherently introducing state
        Introduced AbstractReader to simple permit more simpler class structure
            identification
* .23 - Introducing RGIQE methods with sicd degradation functions and a method
            for producing a sicd/reader with reweighting and/or subaperture
            processing applied
        Minor clean-up of the sarpy.processing structure
        Adjustments to testing framework to allow passage of skipping,
            versus failing, when the referenced test files are not found -
            moving towards conda or conda forge packaging
        Dropping stated Python 2.7 support
* .22 - Eliminating deprecated numpy.object usage
        Include population of North in SIDD exploitation features construction
* .21 - Incorporating unit test for Capella and fixing data transpose issue
* .20 - Bug fix for default Capella naming scheme
* .19 - Adding SICD chipping utility, and more sicd file conversion options
* .18 - Minor change to permit potential preservation of more nitf fields when
        copying and/or a sicd
* .17 - Updating capella reader to accommodate SPOTLIGHT mode
* .16 - Updating the Capella reader to work for actual released data
* .15 - Making the commonly used Fourier windowing functions easily accessible
        in sarpy.processing.windows
* .14 - Added capability to transform between ENU and ECF systems
* .13 - Adding support for GFF version 1.6/1.8 and 2 files
        Including some helper functions for more streamlined use of the AFRL structures
* .12 - Refactoring so that the xml/serialization is more clearly structured
        Adding AFRL labeling schema object oriented structure
* .11 - Updated the logging scheme to be sarpy specific
* .10 - Adding support for Compensated Received Signal Data (CRSD) format reading and writing
* .9 - Fixing typo in Cosmo SkyMed mode handling
* .8 - Handle 2nd generation Cosmo SkyMed QuadPol collections correctly
* .7 - Improve and correct a few SICD validation fixes

       Improve sicd validation for values in GeoData.ImageCorners, GeoData.ValidData,
          and ImageData.ValidData, check consistency between RadarCollection.RcvChannels
          and ImageFormation.RcvChanProc, check consistency between sicd structure and the
          appropriate NITF DES subheader values and Image segment structure
