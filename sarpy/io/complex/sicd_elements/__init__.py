"""
**This sub-package is a work in progress to encapsulate pythonic object oriented SICD structure 1.1 (2014-09-30).**

This purpose of doing it this way is to encourage effective documentation and streamlined use of the SICD information.
This provides more robustness than using structures with no built-in validation, and more flexibility than using the
rigidity of C++ based standards validation.
